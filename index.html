 <p> So I am a 5 ft 10 inches jamaican native. I am currently in my third year, hopefully my final,at the university of the West Indies. My major is in Computer Science and while I am interested in cyber Security, I am quite excited to learn web dev and possibly finish this semester with a skill that can be used to freelance. Bye Now!!</p>
