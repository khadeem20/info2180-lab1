 <h2> Khadeem Lattibeaudiere </h2>
 <p> So I am a 5 ft 10 inches jamaican native. I am currently in my third year, hopefully my final,at the university of the West Indies. My major is in Computer Science and while I am interested in cyber Security, I am quite excited to learn web dev and possibly finish this semester with a skill that can be used to freelance. Bye Now!!
    Also, I am particularly interested in web Dev as it seems as the best entry point into the Tech industry.
